- properly handle ctrl-backspace in micro settings for both windows terminal and vscode
- create function claude-init which initializes the claude cli with a default setup
- update list of recommended extensions
- make systemd unit files readonly

- pull tool installations and updates into a dedicated script that can be repeated after import to update tools
- play around with different fonts
- align terminal nav shortcuts (both in vscode as well as windows terminal)
  - ctrl+shift+pgup/pgdown for scroll page
  - ctrl+shift+up/down for scroll line
