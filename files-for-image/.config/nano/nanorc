# VSCode-like defaults for GNU nano (tailored for Ubuntu + dark theme)

## Include Ubuntu's syntax files (adjust if your distro stores them elsewhere)
include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"
# include "/usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc"

## Editor behavior — VSCode-like defaults
set autoindent           # keep indentation when creating new lines
set tabsize 2            # reduced VSCode default tab size (2 instead of 4)
set tabstospaces         # insert spaces instead of tabs
set softwrap             # soft wrap long lines visually
set linenumbers          # show line numbers
set constantshow         # show cursor position continuously in the status bar
set mouse                # allow mouse clicks and selections
set multibuffer          # allow multiple buffers (like tabs)
set positionlog          # remember cursor position per file
set smarthome            # smarter Home key

## Title / status (dark-friendly)
set titlecolor brightwhite,cyan
set statuscolor brightwhite,black

## Search/navigation
set jumpyscrolling       # smoother paging/jumps

## Clipboard / external helpers
# Uncomment if your nano build supports it
# set clipboard

## VSCode-like keybindings (bind only functions that exist widely)
# Format: bind <key> <function> <menu>
# Use 'all' to apply in all menus where the function exists.

# File operations
bind ^S writeout all        # Ctrl+S = Save
bind ^Q exit all            # Ctrl+Q = Quit

# Find / Replace
bind ^F whereis all         # Ctrl+F = Find
bind ^H replace all         # Ctrl+H = Replace
bind ^G help all            # Ctrl+G = Help

# Navigation
bind M-G gotoline all       # Alt+G = Go to line
bind M-; location all       # Alt+; = Show cursor position (location is supported widely)

# Editing: undo/redo, cut/copy/paste
# Nano 8's "modern" bindings map Ctrl+X/C/V/Z/Y to cut/copy/paste/undo/redo when enabled.
# Here we bind the canonical function names that are widely supported.
bind ^Z undo all            # Ctrl+Z = Undo
bind ^Y redo all            # Ctrl+Y = Redo
bind ^X cut all             # Ctrl+X = Cut (kill)
bind ^C copy all            # Ctrl+C = Copy
bind ^V paste all           # Ctrl+V = Paste
bind ^L zap all             # Ctrl+L = Delete current line

# Selection
bind ^A mark all            # Ctrl+A = Select all (mark entire buffer)
bind M-/ mark all           # Alt+/ = Toggle selection

# Indent / unindent
bind M-] indent all         # Alt+] = Indent selection or line
bind M-[ unindent all       # Alt+[ = Unindent selection or line

# Search again
bind M-? findnext all       # Alt+? = Repeat search

# Cancel selection for yes/no dialogs
bind ^C cancel yesno

## Colors & theme
set fill 80                 # visual line length guide

## Notes & troubleshooting (kept verbose for clarity)
# - nano 8 introduced optional "modern bindings" that map Ctrl+X/C/V/Z/Y etc.
# You can enable them by invoking nano with `--modernbindings` or by calling
# nano through a symlink whose basename starts with "e" (e.g. `enano` or `e`).
# See nano's release notes and the nanorc manpage for details.
# - If nano fails to start because of an unknown option or bind, comment that line
# and restart nano. Different distributions and builds expose slightly different
# sets of options and function names — this file sticks to the features that are
# broadly supported in the 8.x series on Ubuntu.
# - To inspect what options your installed nano supports, run: `man nanorc` or `nano -V`.
# - If you want a complete Solarized Dark / Monokai-like syntax included directly,
# I can add it below (would be a sizeable block). Tell me which theme and I'll
# append it.

# End of configuration (compatible with nano 8.6 on Ubuntu)
